## What is NBTC?

The National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC) is an annual competition organized by the 'STEM Careers Programme'.
The competition aims to identify and encourage talented students in the field of biology.
The contest is open to students in grades 9-11, and the top four winners are given the opportunity to represent
Pakistan at the International Biology Olympiad (IBO).

### What is IBO?

International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is the world's largest biology competition for high school students
and takes place every year in a different country. All participating countries send four winners of their
National Biology Olympiad (i.e. NBTC in Pakistan) to the IBO, usually accompanied by two adults who are
members of the international jury for the duration of the competition.

For more information, visit our [encyclopedic page about IBO](/p/nbtc/ibo).

### How can I represent Pakistan in IBO?

In order to be selected as a representative for Pakistan in the International Biology Olympiad (IBO), you must first pass the Screening Test of the National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC). The top 50 students who pass the screening test will then be invited to participate in training and selection camps held at the Home Institute (HI) of NBTC. From these camps, the top 4 students will be chosen to represent Pakistan in IBO, based on their performance during the camp.

### Home Institute (HI)

The National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE) located in Faisalabad serves as the Home Institute (HI) for the National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC). NIBGE is one of the four main biotechnology centers under the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and is a leading institution in the field of modern biotechnology. The institute aims to support the development of the country through the application of cutting-edge biotechnology and genetic engineering technologies.

Are you curious to know more about NIBGE? Visit their official website.

### Training/Selection Camps

The additional training for students at the host institute does not exceed a duration of 5-6 weeks. The training is divided into four rounds:

- The first round includes lectures and a test.
- The second round also includes lectures and a test.
- The third round includes only a test.
- The final round is dedicated to practical training.

## Paper Pattern of Screening Test

### Part I

Part I has 5 MCQs (multiple-choice questions) from each of the four disciplines (Biology/Computer, Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics) of the competition (so there is a total of 20 MCQs), and all the candidates are expected to attempt this part. It carries 20 marks.

### Part II (MCQs Portion)

Part II consists of 50 MCQs from your particular discipline (in which you have applied). It carries 50 marks.

In parts I and II, each correct answer will carry 1 mark. There will be negative marking (deduction of 1/3 mark for each incorrect MCQ answer).

### Part III (Subjective Portion)

This portion consists of 7-8 descriptive questions. You have to attempt 5-6 questions from this portion. There will be a choice to skip 2 questions in this part. It carries 30 marks. Each question of this portion carries 5-6 marks. [6 marks for each, if there are 5 questions. 5 marks for each, if there are 6 questions.]

Note: You may have seen the sample paper of NBTC, in which there are only 2 descriptive questions in subjective type. Keep in mind that the sample paper is too old (2011). Now the number of questions is increased in the latest papers.

| Part            | Questions                 | Marks   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| I               | 5 MCQs (Biology/Computer) | 20      |
|                 | 5 MCQs (Chemistry)        |         |
|                 | 5 MCQs (Mathematics)      |         |
|                 | 5 MCQs (Physics)          |         |
| II              | 50 MCQs                   | 50      |
| III             | 5 Descriptive Questions   | 30      |
| **Total Marks** |                           | **100** |

## How to prepare for the test?

Finally, here is the most asked question.

The methodology of preparation for the Screening Test is quite simple: AT LEAST PREPARE FSC/A-LEVELS BOOKS.

For Matric/O Levels Students: To succeed in this test, it's important to not only rely on your matric level books but also to supplement your studies with F.Sc/A-Level materials. This will give you an edge over other contestants and increase your chances of ranking among the top 50 students. To achieve greater success, you should commit to a comprehensive study plan that includes both matric and F.Sc/A-Level level materials.

### Instructions for Preparations:

1. As your principal subject is Biology, save more time for this subject. (Don't waste your time on other subjects)
2. First of all, grasp the general biological terms.
3. Prepare the definitions as a lot of such MCQs are asked in Screening Test. (Statement is given in the questions, and you will have to choose the correct biological term)
4. Your concepts should be crystal-clear as most of the descriptive questions are conceptual.
5. Preparation means conceptual learning and memorization of the topic along with some practice.

Let's focus on the preparation of each part one by one.

### Part I

The Part-I of the NSTC Screening Test is an important section that all contestants must complete, regardless of their principal subject. The MCQs in this section will cover basic concepts and understanding across a range of subjects. The NSTC is not just about mastering one subject, it's also about having a general understanding of different subjects. The questions in this section will test your general knowledge of other subjects. This is why it is important to not just focus on your principal subject but also to study and practice questions from different subject areas.

Now I am going to divide this further into four parts for each subject.

#### 1. Biology (5 MCQs)

As a Biology student, you have an advantage in this section of the test. The questions will cover fundamental concepts and terms in Biology and will draw from a wide range of topics. You can expect to be tested on your knowledge of general biology concepts. The examiner may ask about the percentage of oxygen in our body, the definition of population, etc.

#### 2. Chemistry (5 MCQs)

This section of the test may present some challenges for you. Like in Biology, the questions in this portion will not focus on any specific topic in Chemistry. The paper-setter may choose questions from any area of the subject, so it is important to have a solid understanding of chemistry concepts as a whole. Basic terms such as electronegativity, ionic bonds, acids, and bases, should be well-known to you.

<Quiz
  question="Which of the following statements best describes the electropositivity trend in the periodic table?"
  options={[
    "A) Elements become more electropositive as you move from left to right across a row (period) and from top to bottom within a column (group).",
    "B) Elements become more electropositive as you move from right to left across a row (period) and from bottom to top within a column (group).",
    "C) Elements become less electropositive as you move from left to right across a row (period) and from top to bottom within a column (group).",
    "D) Elements become less electropositive as you move from right to left across a row (period) and from bottom to top within a column (group).",
  ]}
  correctAnswer="B) Elements become more electropositive as you move from right to left across a row (period) and from bottom to top within a column (group)."
/>

#### 3. Mathematics (5 MCQs)

If you excelled in mathematics during your school years, this portion of the test should be relatively easy for you. Again, basic terms - for example, rational number, irrational number, area, etc. - are usually asked in the test.

<Quiz
  question="Which of the following is a rational number?"
  options={["A) √2", "B) 3/5", "C) π", "D) log2"]}
  correctAnswer="B) 3/5"
/>

#### 4. Physics (5 MCQs)

This section of the test will focus on physics concepts and understanding, with a potential for one or two questions that require numerical calculations.

Note: There may be one/two difficult MCQs in each portion of Part-I. So be ready, be prepared.

### Part II (MCQs Portion)

Note: This portion is not completed yet. It will be updated soon.

EVERY TOPIC is important for the preparation. Don't ignore even a single topic. There will be MCQs in your test from almost every chapter of the 11th and 12th. Again, I repeat, grasp the basic concepts first of all.

### Part III (Subjective Portion)

Note: This portion is not completed yet. It will be updated soon.

DON'T even think to SKIP GENETICS, there can be at least one or even two descriptive questions from this portion.

Note: There may be descriptive questions from Campbell Biology (or any similar higher-order book). Most probably, there would be a maximum of two questions like this. So you can skip these questions in choice. But it would only be possible in that case, if you attempt all the other 5 questions. (which will be, most probably, from FSC/A Levels )

## Extra Chapters of F.Sc/ A Level

In the following table, I have synchronized the chapters of Matric & O Level with Intermediate & A Level.

HOW TO USE THIS TABLE?

1. This table is constructed with reference to Biology 9 & 10 books. The chapters of these books are written in order from 1 to 18 in the first column.
2. The Intermediate/ A Level chapters, which are not present in Matric/O Level books, are written in bold in the third (Intermediate) and fourth (AS & A Level) column.
3. This way, students of the Matric/O Level can study extra chapters/topics not present in their books.

| **MATRIC**                    | **O Level**                                         | **INTERMEDIATE**               | **AS & A Level**                                   |

## Books

You may prepare Biology books of any province (Punjab/ KPK/Sindh/Federal/Balochistan) or A-Levels books, which are more comprehensive in some domains.

It's important to remember that the goal of studying a textbook is to gain a deep understanding of the concepts. If you have a clear grasp of a topic, you will be able to answer any related question on the test.

Note: A-levels students should prepare the biodiversity portion from F.Sc books. There may be a descriptive question from this portion. In fact, a question about biodiversity was included in the NBTC-17 test.

## Effective Time Management

The duration of the test is 180 minutes or 3 hours.

### Part I

- This section contains 20 multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
- The suggested time allocation for this section is 30 minutes, with 90 seconds allocated for each question.

### Part II (MCQs Portion)

- This section contains 50 multiple-choice questions (MCQs).
- The recommended time for this section is 75 minutes, or 1 hour and 15 minutes, with 90 seconds allocated for each question.

### Part III (Subjective Portion)

- This section includes 5-6 descriptive questions.
- The recommended time allocation for this section is 60 minutes, with 10-12 minutes allocated for each question.

### Commenting

The final 15 minutes of the test should be dedicated to analyzing and providing comments on the question paper. This includes:

- Examining the nature of the questions
- Identifying errors or confusion in the paper
- Expressing your opinion on the difficulty level of the paper
- Identifying areas where the paper could be improved.
  In summary, this portion of the test should be used for a post-examination analysis. It is highly recommended that you complete this analysis, as it can give you an advantage over other contestants.
