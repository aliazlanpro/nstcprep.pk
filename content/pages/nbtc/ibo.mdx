## Introduction

The International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is the association that organizes the world's premier Biology competition for high and secondary school students.

To take part in the IBO, the students must be in the top four in the National Biology Olympiad (i.e. NBTC in Pakistan) in their individual countries.

In Pakistan, these top students are selected through [National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC)](/nbtc).

## Aims

In bringing together gifted students, the IBO competition challenges and stimulates these students to expand their talents and promote their future careers as scientists.

The IBO aims to provide young students with an educational experience, as well as promote interest in biology.

The IBO provides an ideal opportunity for collaboration and inspiration between students, researchers, and universities across national borders.

## Brief History

The IBO competition was founded in 1989 by six countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and the Soviet Union) and held the first competition in Olomouc in July 1990. In 2017, the IBO became an officially registered association with its seat in Kiel, Germany.

The IBO has been organized since 1990 and has 78 member countries at present. Pakistan participated in IBO as an observer country in 2005.

## Exams

The exam questions in IBO require a deep conceptual understanding of biology, typically much beyond what regular biology school books cover at the upper secondary level.

The vast majority of IBO exam questions concern the application of biological knowledge in contexts that have been taken from recent biological research. In many of these tasks, students analyze - for example - data from biological experiments and then have to think about what conclusions can be drawn from these data.

### Theory Exam

The theory exam will be comprised of 2 test papers. Each will have 50 problems and 180 min to complete the test.

The theory exam tests the competitors’ understanding, processing skills, and application of biological knowledge. Questions require understanding, rather than knowledge. Theoretical questions cover the following topics in the indicated proportions.

| Section | Topic                                                                                            | Percentage |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| I       | Cell biology (Structure and function of cells and their components, Microbiology, Biotechnology) |        20% |
| II      | Plant anatomy and physiology (with emphasis on seed plants)                                      |        15% |
| III     | Animal anatomy and physiology (with emphasis on vertebrates and especially man)                  |        25% |
| IV      | Ethology                                                                                         |         5% |
| V       | Genetics and Evolution                                                                           |        20% |
| VI      | Ecology                                                                                          |        10% |
| VII     | Biosystematics                                                                                   |         5% |

### Practical Exam

The tasks in the practical examination should concentrate on the evaluation of the competitors’ ability to solve biological problems using the skills and methods commonly used in biological laboratories.

The amazing thing about this contest is about 70% of the participants can manage to get one of the awards.

- Gold Medal: Top 10% of participants
- Silver Medal: Next 20% of participants
- Bronze Medal: Next 30% of participants
- Certificate of Merit: Next 10% of participants

## Achievements of Pakistan

Pakistan participated in IBO as an observer country in 2005. Pakistani students have been participating regularly in International Biology Olympiad (IBO) since 2006. These students are selected every year through National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC).
