## What is NBTC?

National Biology Talent Contest (NBTC) is one of the contests of National Science Talent Contest (NSTC). NSTC is held every year under the umbrella of 'STEM Careers Programme' which is a joint venture of 'Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)' and 'Higher Education Commission (HEC)'.

You can represent your country Pakistan in International Biology Olympiad (IBO) through this contest.

## What is IBO?

The International Biology Olympiad (IBO) is an annual biology competition for high school students. More than 75 countries are part of IBO. Each national delegation is made up of at most four student competitors usually accompanied by two adults who are members of the international jury for the duration of the competition. For their efforts, about 70% of the participants are awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honorable mention.

For more information, visit our [dedicated page](/p/nbtc/ibo) for IBO.

You may visit the [official website of IBO](https://ibo-info.org) for more details.

## How can I represent Pakistan in IBO?

To represent Pakistan in International Biology Olympiad (IBO), you have to pass the Screening Test of NSTC (Biology). Then, the students who qualified in Screening Test will participate in Training/Selection Camps held at the Home Institute (HI) of NBTC. 4 students will be selected, on the basis of their performance in these camps, for participation in the IBO.

## Home Institution (HI)

The home institute of NBTC is 'National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE)' in Faislabad. NIBGE is one of the main biotechnology institutes of the four bioscience centers of PAEC. The institute is a focal point of modern biotechnology and provides a technology-receiving unit to help the development of the country through applications of modern biotechnology and genetic engineering.

The host institute harbors the National Library of Biological Sciences where a large collection of books, online material, etc. is available to the students for preparing themselves for the IBO. [Past IBO papers](/p/nbtc/ibo#past-papers) are also used in addition to the indigenously developed tests.
