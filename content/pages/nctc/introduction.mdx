## Introduction

### What is NCTC?

National Chemistry Talent Contest (NCTC) is one of the contests of National Science Talent Contest (NSTC). NSTC is held every year under the umbrella of 'STEM Careers Programme' which is a joint venture of 'Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)' and 'Higher Education Commission (HEC)'.

You can represent your country Pakistan in International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) through this contest.

### What is IChO?

The International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) is an annual chemsitry competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. Each national delegation is made up of at most five student competitors plus two mentors (one of them is nominated as head of the delegation), selected on a national level. For their efforts, about half of the participants are awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honorable mention.

You may visit the [official website of IChO](https://www.icho.sk/) for more details.

### How can I represent Pakistan in IChO?

To represent Pakistan in International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO), you have to pass the Screening Test of NSTC (Chemistry). Then, the students who qualified in Screening Test will participate in Training/Selection Camps held at the Home Institute (HI) of NCTC. 5 students will be selected, on the basis of their performance in these camps, for participation in the IChO.

### Home Institution (HI)

The home institute of NCTC is 'H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry (International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences [ICCBS])' in Karachi. Its reputation for scientific research and training extends far beyond the country's borders. ICCBS emerged from the generous support from the private sector and was sustained by the government's grants. In the last 51 years has earned major recognition from Pakistan, apart from training thousands of young researchers from home and abroad in frontiers areas of science and technology.
