## Introduction

### What is NMTC?

National Mathematics Talent Contest (NMTC) is one of the contests of National Science Talent Contest (NSTC). NSTC is held every year under the umbrella of 'STEM Careers Programme' which is a joint venture of 'Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS)' and 'Higher Education Commission (HEC)'.

You can represent your country Pakistan in International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) through this contest.

### What is IMO?

The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is an annual mathematics competition for high school students. More than 100 countries are part of IMO. Each national delegation is made up of at most six student competitors usually accompanied by two adults who are members of the international jury for the duration of the competition.

You may visit the [official website of IMO](https://www.imo-official.org) for more details.

### How can I represent Pakistan in IMO?

To represent Pakistan in International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), you have to pass the Screening Test of NSTC (Mathematics). Then, the students who qualified in Screening Test will participate in Training/Selection Camps held at the Home Institute (HI) of NMTC. 6 students will be selected, on the basis of their performance in these camps, for participation in the IMO.
